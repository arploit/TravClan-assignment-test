Hello,
With 1.10 years of hands-on experience in Reactjs, Redux, JavaScript, Nodejs, Html, and CSS3. I offer the technical expertise you are seeking for your Front End Developer position as advertised on the LinkedIn Jobs page.

Since earning my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Gyan Ganga institute of technology and science. I have served as a Web developer in the Yardi, Pune. I have worked on different projects related to creating new UI elements from scratch according to the client's requirements, Debugging existing code, and also worked on developing internal projects. As a challenge, I have developed a complete working shopping website "www.artkord.com" in Reactjs, APIs on Nodejs deployed them in the AWS lambda function.

As a front-end web developer, I am intrigued by UI as this is the element which interacts with customer and this interaction can make or break the product and I am highly motivated in developing a UI which will be loved by the customer. Now, I am ready to work on projects that are more challenging and can affect more lives.

I look forward to interview for the Front End Developer position. If my skills match your requirement, please contact me at +91-7440777504 or you can email me at arpesh.11@gmail.com to setup up a meeting. Thank you
